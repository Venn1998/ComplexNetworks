# ComplexNetworks
Simple projects to understand concepts from the Complex Network course at UOC

In 1_StructuralDescriptors are investigated different structural descriptors for many networks provided by the professor (in the A1-networks folder).
After this, to analyze the degree distribution of the networks, we plot the Probability Distribution Function, Cumulative Distribution Function and Complementary CDF for each network, in lin-lin or log-log scale, depending on the properties of the degree distribution.


In 2_Models I implemented many generators of complex networks models: 
- Erdös-Rényi (ER) networks, either G(N,K) or G(N,p)
- Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world model
- Barabási & Albert (BA) preferential attachment model
- Configuration Model (CM)

There's also an estimation of the exponent for the empirical degree distributions of BA and CM (SF).
