Monte Carlo simulation of an epidemic spreading dynamics in complex networks, using the SIS model in which each node represents an individual which can be in two possible state: Susceptible (S), i.e. healthy but can get infected; Infected (I), i.e. has the disease and can spread it to the neighbors.
I calculated the fraction of infected nodes, ρ, in the stationay state, as a function of the infection probability of the disease β, for different values of the recovery probability μ. This was done on different undirected networks (e.g. Erdös-Rényi, scale-free, real), different sizes, average degrees, exponents, etc.
Moreover, the ρ(β) result obtained from Monte Carlo simulations was compared with the theoretical prediction provided by the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) model.
